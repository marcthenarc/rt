# rt

A small raytracer in C++.

This is a port from the TypeCcript demo at https://www.typescriptlang.org/samples/index.html which is, most likely, an uncredited port of a C# version created by Luke Hoban at https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/lukeh/2007/04/03/a-ray-tracer-in-c3-0/  (both projects are from Microsoft related sites.)
I did this over 3 years ago only to forget all about it and leave it on an external hard drive all this time.

- Quirks.

Outputs to a Type 2, 24 bits, top left, non-RLE TGA file.
Added a parameter to loop the process and create a camera movement just to see if it could handle animation.

- Licence.

Neither the Typescript version nor the C# version have licences.  My port is non-commercial and created only in the spirit of learning and provides no guarantee.

If you find this piece of software useful, you can buy me a beer in return.
